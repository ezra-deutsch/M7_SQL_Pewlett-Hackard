# SQL_Pewlett-Hackard - Module 7 - Challenge

### Overview and Purpose

This challenge was our first attempt to build a simple database and use SQL to relate the tables together and extract meaningful data. Pewlett-Hackard is a mature company that has always kept its employee files organized using Excel and VBA. We have been given six csv files to build our database and tasked with learning about the potential for retirees in the coming years.

### Results

Pewlett Harkard has: 
*240,124 total employees

### Summary:

How many roles will be needed to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact? 

This question is one that definitely needs to be researched and answered for Pewlett-Hackard to properly transition to a new paradigm of a younger workforce. However, this cannot be answered completely without having a better understanding of workflow and technology usage. 90,398 current employees are born between Jan 1, 1952, and Dec 31, 1955. These positions are all currently "at-risk" of being vacated during the retirement wave. How many of these positions are required to be filled? We can't be sure if that is directly a one-to-one ratio. Perhaps through better workflow, Pewlett-Hackard may only need to fill 1 out of every 2 (or more) retirees.

Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett-Hackard employees?

Pewlett-Hackard's entire employee pool is headed for a major shift. 38% of all employees are entering retirement age. The current Mentorship pool is 1,549 people. On average this is 97 current employees per Mentor. If Pewlett-Hackard is able to refine its mentee candidacy it will be able to utilize its senior staff to train up lower level employees before a brain drain occurs. Pewlett-Hackard needs to act now and implement an internal training process as soon as possible. Perhaps this training is multitiered and is offered every year for the foreseeable future. Pewlett-Hackard has a very mature workforce and needs to make long term plans immediately.
